### Quick Start

- Install dependencies by running `npm i`.

- Run `npm run serve` to start the local development server.

- ðŸ˜Ž **That's it!** You're ready to start building awesome dashboards.

<br  />

### Project Structure

- All templates are located inside `src/views` and most of them are self-contained.

- There's only one single layout defined (Default) inside `src/layouts`, however the current structure provides an easy way of extending the UI kit.

- The `src/components` directory hosts all template-specific subcomponents in their own subdirectory.

- Almost all components have their styles isolated in SFC, however, some global styles are also placed inside `src/assets/scss` next to Shards Dashboard Lite's base styles.

- The `src/utils` directory contains generic Chart.js utilities.
